# Project Overview

- **Forecast Horizon:** 2026â€“2030  
- **Scenario Analysis:** Bull, Base, Bear  
- **Valuation Techniques:** DCF with terminal value, GGM, Exit Multiple

- ROIC, ROE, and ROA are negative in the base case, suggesting inefficient capital deployment.
- Share price and market capitalization decrease slightly, despite marginal EPS improvement.
